This Smart ATM project implements a Monolithic MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture as a single-threaded desktop application.

Monolithic Desktop Application - All components (GUI, ML inference, data persistence, business logic) execute in one Python process without external services or APIs.

Design Pattern: MVC
The BankUi class naturally follows MVC separation adapted for Tkinter:

Component	Implementation	Key Methods/Features
Model	Data layer + ML models	pandas CSV ops (write_to_csv, user_deposit_trans), pickled SVM (train_model, video_check), face embeddings
View:	Tkinter UI screens	Frame-based navigation (final_page, withdraw_money_page), buttons/labels/entries
Controller:	BankUi class	Orchestrates flow (begin_page → enroll_user → video_capture_page → video_check → final_page)


Technologies used:
Python:
Acts as the primary programming language to glue all components: GUI, face recognition, ML model, and CSV database.
Provides access to libraries like OpenCV, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, imutils, and Tkinter in a single ecosystem, making it suitable for rapid prototyping of such systems.
​
Tkinter (GUI):
Used to build the ATM-style graphical interface:Welcome screen, enrollment screen (name/password input, capture instructions), login/verification screen, and transaction screens (deposit, withdraw, transfer, balance enquiry).
Handles all buttons, labels, input fields, and page navigation by switching frames (Frame widgets), so the user experiences it like a real ATM flow.

OpenCV (Face recognition):
Used for video capture and image processing from the webcam (cv2.VideoCapture, VideoStream)
Uses DNN-based face detection via cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe with the SSD face detection model and then extracts the face region from frames.
​Loads a pre-trained Torch model (nn4.small2.v1.t7) to convert each detected face into a 128‑D embedding vector, which is then used for recognition.

scikit-learn (SVM classifier)
Used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVC) classifier on the face embeddings generated by the OpenCV/OpenFace model.
​The SVM learns to separate embeddings of different users, so at runtime you can call recognizer.predict_proba(vec) to get the most likely user ID and probability for each face.
LabelEncoder is used to map user IDs (unique_id) to numeric labels and back.

pandas (CSV “database”):
Treats bank_details.csv as a lightweight database for account storage.
Read user data and balances (pd.read_csv).
Filter rows by unique_id or account_number to validate users and look up balances.
Update balances on deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and write back to CSV (to_csv) as persistent storage.

NumPy
Supports numerical operations on embeddings and image-related data structures.
Works with OpenCV and scikit-learn because both rely on NumPy arrays for images, feature vectors, and model inputs/outputs.

imutils (VideoStream, FPS, paths)
VideoStream is used for threaded video capture, making real-time face recognition smoother than plain cv2.VideoCapture.
​FPS is used to measure performance (elapsed time and frames per second) during the face recognition loop.
​paths.list_images is used in get_embeddings() to iterate over all images in the dataset folders and build the embedding dataset.
​

pickle (model serialization)
Used to save and load trained models and data:
Saves face embeddings and names to embeddings.pickle.
Saves the trained SVM recognizer to recognizer.pickle and the label encoder to le.pickle.


Motto:
“The idea came from real-world ATM security issues. Many users lose money due to PIN theft or shoulder surfing. I wanted to create a more secure system that authenticates users automatically through face recognition before allowing transactions.”



Flow:
Enrollment Phase: The user enters their details and captures facial images (5 images) which are stored and used to generate facial embeddings using a deep learning model (OpenCV + pre-trained embedding model nn4.small2.v1.t7).
Authentication Phase: When a user selects ‘Login,’ the webcam captures a live video stream, detects a face using OpenCV’s DNN-based face detector, and matches embeddings against the trained SVM model to recognize the person.
Transaction Phase: Once the face is verified, the user logs in with a password and can perform operations like check balance, deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds, all managed via a Tkinter GUI and a CSV-based database implemented using pandas.​
